Version 0.1 notes:
    - Most Viable Product(ish)
    - Placeholder assets
    - Game logic very inefficient, especially when more enemies are being rendered
        - Although it now runs more optimized using convert_alpha() on images
    - Enemies wont appear unless you actually shoot somewhere
    - No audio
    - No proper menu or text rendering

Version 0.1.1 notes:
    - Now game runs continously, event if there's no events
